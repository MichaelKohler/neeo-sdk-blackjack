Just some blackjack..

### TODO

Critical:
* Implement pseudo device through neeo-sdk
* Implement text component showing player cards
* Implement text component showing dealer cards
* Implement text component showing command question
* Implement command buttons

Very good to have:

* Count 'A' as either 11 or 1 depending on the situation
* Draw on Dealer having soft 16

Nice to have:

* Split implementation (will need to have a concept of 'hands')
* Double implementation
